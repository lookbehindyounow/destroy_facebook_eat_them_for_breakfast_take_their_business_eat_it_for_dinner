# Social Media Website

A standard social media website

## MVP:

- A `User` should be able to make a `Post` & anyone who can see the `Post` should be able to make a `Comment` or upvote/bump/like the post in some kind of way
- Should be able to view `User`'s pages with their details at the top & all their `Post`s below
- Should be able to get to any `User`'s page by clicking on any reference to said `User`
- Should be able to delete `Post`s & `Comment`s if you made them
- If a `Post` is deleted, so are it's `Comment`s
- `User`s should be able to make friends or associate with other `User`s in some way

## Possible Extensions:

- replies to comments or some kind of nested commenting structure
- choose between public posts or friends only
- pages that users can create for businesses, organisations, etc.
- something wacky to stand out
- I'll come up with others probably (if I get this far)
